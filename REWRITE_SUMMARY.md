   - Updated to work with new event structure

7. **tests/plenary/minimal_init.lua** (UPDATED)
   - Added environment variable mocking
   - Better plenary.nvim handling

   - Comprehensive Google Calendar API setup instructions
   - OAuth 2.0 credential creation guide
   - Environment variable setup
   - Authentication flow documentation
   - Updated feature list
   - Troubleshooting section
   - File format documentation

9. **CHANGELOG.md** (NEW)
   - Detailed changelog of all changes
   - Migration notes

10. **MIGRATION.md** (NEW)
    - Step-by-step migration guide from gcalcli version
    - Troubleshooting for common migration issues

11. **QUICKREF.md** (NEW)
    - Quick reference for commands and workflows
    - Configuration examples
    - Common patterns and automation ideas

12. **example_config.lua** (NEW)
    - Complete example configuration
    - Optional autocommand examples
    - Commented with explanations

13. **.gitignore** (NEW)
    - Exclude token.json from version control
    - Standard ignores for the project

## Key Features Added

### 1. Event Tracking
- Events now have unique IDs stored in `:GCAL_ID:` property
- Enables reliable update and deletion synchronization
- Prevents duplicate event creation

### 2. Update Synchronization
- Changes to events in Google Calendar are synced to org files
- Changes to org files are synced to Google Calendar
- Uses `:GCAL_UPDATED:` timestamp to determine which version is newer

### 3. Deletion Synchronization
- Events deleted from Google Calendar are removed from org files
- Automatic cleanup during import

### 4. OAuth 2.0 Authentication
- Secure authentication flow
- Token stored locally with automatic refresh
- No need to store credentials in plain text

### 5. Better Error Handling
- Detailed error messages from API
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Clear user notifications

## Architecture Changes

### Old Architecture (gcalcli-based)
```
Neovim → Shell → gcalcli → Google Calendar API
```

### New Architecture (direct API)
```
Neovim → plenary.curl → Google Calendar API
```

Benefits:
- Fewer dependencies
- Faster sync (no shell overhead)
- Better error messages
- More control over API calls
- Token management built-in

## API Design

### Authentication Flow
1. User runs `:OrgGcalAuth`
2. Browser opens to Google OAuth consent page
3. User authorizes and receives code
4. User pastes code into Neovim
5. Token is exchanged and saved
6. Future requests use saved token
7. Token auto-refreshes when needed

### Sync Flow

#### Import (Google Calendar → Org)
1. Fetch events from Google Calendar API
2. Compare with existing org files
3. Create new events
4. Update modified events (if Google Calendar version is newer)
5. Delete events that no longer exist in Google Calendar

#### Export (Org → Google Calendar)
1. Scan org-roam directories for scheduled tasks
2. Compare with Google Calendar events
3. Create new events
4. Update existing events (by GCAL_ID)

## Breaking Changes

1. **Removed gcalcli dependency** - Must set up Google Calendar API credentials
2. **Environment variables required** - GCAL_ORG_SYNC_CLIENT_ID and GCAL_ORG_SYNC_CLIENT_SECRET
3. **Authentication required** - Must run `:OrgGcalAuth` on first use
4. **File format change** - Events now include `:GCAL_ID:` and `:GCAL_UPDATED:` properties

## Migration Path

Users of the old version should:
1. Set up Google Calendar API credentials
2. Set environment variables
3. Run `:OrgGcalAuth`
4. Run `:SyncOrgGcal` to add IDs to existing events

## Testing

All tests updated to:
- Mock Google Calendar API calls
- Test new sync features (updates, deletions)
- Verify event ID tracking
- Test OAuth token handling

Run tests with:
```bash
nvim --headless -c "PlenaryBustedDirectory tests/plenary { minimal_init = 'tests/minimal_init.lua' }"
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Multiple calendar support
- Recurring event support
- Conflict resolution UI
- Sync status dashboard
- More granular sync control (per-directory)
- Webhook support for real-time sync

## Credits

This rewrite maintains backward compatibility with user workflows while modernizing the underlying implementation for better reliability and features.
